 # Backend Engingeer Test

This is a power test is meant to be submitted within 48 hours of receipt. We expect that you implement all tasks in the same project using Python. 

You will be judged on a scale of 100 for completion, correctness, clean code and documentation.

There's only one Task for you to do here. We will also award bonus points for any extra justifiable considerations/improvements added to the application.

Your final score determines whether we will proceed to the next round of the interview.


## Tasks Background

You are tasked to build a receipt generation API that allows only authenticated and authorized users to generate multiple (at least 10) receipts per request.


## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- the solution is available on either Github or Gitlab. Please add the following GitHub account as a maintainer: @simone-dexter if using GitHub

- appropriate API documentation is added to the project

- API is deployed to Heroku (or a cloud hosting equivalent)

- Bonus points for a very simple front-end application (could be in React or Vue) that consumes the API. You can send us a link to this app hosted on either Vercel or Netlify.


All the best!
